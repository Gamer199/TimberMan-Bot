A simple Bot which plays the Timberman Steam Version on Windows, it is only working in Single Player.

Instructions:

1.Download the Files
2.Open Timberman in Windowed Mode
3.Go to Single Player and start the round
4.When chopping is ready start the script
5.The Script stops automatically, when you die

Additional Notes:
The script is not perfect.
Sometimes when the branches start on the right side you die.
When the game lags the bot doesn't work really well.
The Snow Biome often lags.
This bot wasn't written for multiplayer, but can be modified, by changing the coordinates, which check if branches are
nearby.
